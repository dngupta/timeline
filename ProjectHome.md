Ever wondered what was happening elsewhere in the world when you were born?

Or have you ever wanted to know if Led Zeppelin was still together when Pink Floyd released Dark Side of the Moon?

When Pearl Harbor was attacked, what was going on in Cuba?

I've wondered these sorts of things, and I wanted a way to correlate this information based on the dates that were involved.

This will be the app to do it.
